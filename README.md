This is the second attempt of trying to build something that is able to abstract away data flow in programs ([My First Try](https://github.com/NoNaim95/fbp-rs)).
And basically I ended up reimplementing `Iterators`s and `FnMut`s (At the time I didn't know how cool Rust `Iterator`s where). The moment I've realized that, I happily used `Iterator`s and `FnMut`s.
throughout all of my projects, mainly [Cooltraption Playground](https://github.com/NoNaim95/cooltraption_playground).
